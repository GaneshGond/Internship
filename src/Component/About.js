        <p >Throughout your life, you’ll have many opportunities to create a first impression, like in job interviews, on the first day of work, or at networking events. 

And you can never make a first impression again. That’s why understanding and embracing your positive personality traits and using the right words to describe yourself are crucial to becoming (and having people perceive you as) the person you want to be.

You might think you’re stuck with the personality you were born with, but consider this: the Latin term “persona” is the root word for “personality.” And “persona” means “mask.” Your personality isn’t an unchangeable representation of who you are inside. It’s the mask you portray to the world, and you can change it.
